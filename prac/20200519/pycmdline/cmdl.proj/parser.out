Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> statement
Rule 1     statement -> expression
Rule 2     expression -> expression + expression
Rule 3     expression -> expression - expression
Rule 4     expression -> NUMBER

Terminals, with rules where they appear

+                    : 2
-                    : 3
NUMBER               : 4
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 1 2 2 3 3
statement            : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . statement
    (1) statement -> . expression
    (2) expression -> . expression + expression
    (3) expression -> . expression - expression
    (4) expression -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3

    statement                      shift and go to state 1
    expression                     shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> statement .



state 2

    (1) statement -> expression .
    (2) expression -> expression . + expression
    (3) expression -> expression . - expression

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (statement -> expression .)
    +               shift and go to state 4
    -               shift and go to state 5


state 3

    (4) expression -> NUMBER .

    +               reduce using rule 4 (expression -> NUMBER .)
    -               reduce using rule 4 (expression -> NUMBER .)

state 4

    (2) expression -> expression + . expression
    (2) expression -> . expression + expression
    (3) expression -> . expression - expression
    (4) expression -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3

    expression                     shift and go to state 6

state 5

    (3) expression -> expression - . expression
    (2) expression -> . expression + expression
    (3) expression -> . expression - expression
    (4) expression -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3

    expression                     shift and go to state 7

state 6

    (2) expression -> expression + expression .
    (2) expression -> expression . + expression
    (3) expression -> expression . - expression
